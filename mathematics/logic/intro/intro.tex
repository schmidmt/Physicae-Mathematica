\section{Introduction}

Logic stems from the ancient Greek word \greek{lo'goc} (l\'{o}gos), which means \emph{that which is though or said}.
The reason we bring this up now is logic underpins all of mathematics.
More formally, we say mathematics is a formal system.
We will discuss what a formal system is later (see \ref{defn:formalSystem}) but for now, think of it as a construction of rules all logically compatible and built on a logical foundation.

Using a logical foundation allows us to trust the tools we will build.
Without this, we could not be sure when our math worked and tells us something true or something false.
