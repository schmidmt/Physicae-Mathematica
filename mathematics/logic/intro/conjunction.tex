\subsection{Conjunction (And)}

Now, suppose we have two different statements, say $A$ and $B$.
We may like combine the two and make a new statement.
One possible way to combine the two is to require both to be true for the joint statement to be true.
We call this joining conjunction.

\begin{defn}
\index{Conjunction}
\index{And|see{Conjunction}}
\label{defn:conjunction}
  The \textbf{conjunction (and)} operator $\land$ combines two statements, say $A$ and $B$ in such a way that $A\land B$ is only true if both $A$ and $B$ are true. 
\end{defn}

Conjunction allows us to look at situations where we would care only if all constituent parts are true.
We can see this strength in a truth table below:

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $A$ & $B$ & $A \land B$ \\
    \toprule
    T & T & T \\
    T & F & F \\
    F & T & F \\
    F & F & F \\
  \end{tabular}
