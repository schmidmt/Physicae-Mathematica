\subsection{Statements}

To begin, we required a container to hold an idea so we may investigate the logic contained within.
We call this idea container a statement.

\begin{defn}
	\index{Statement}
  \index{Proposition|see{Statement}}
  \label{defn:statement}
  A \textbf{statement} is any sentence which must be \emph{True} or \emph{False}.
  We will refer to statements usually by a letter, e.g.\ $S$.
\end{defn}

Each statement can contain multiple ideas.
However, we'll start with simple examples containing only one each and, later, we'll go through how to combine statements.

\begin{ex}
  To illustrate a simple statement take for instance the following statement:
  \textbf{The sky is blue.}
  This statement is true.
\end{ex}
