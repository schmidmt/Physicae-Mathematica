\section{Introduction}
Here we are at the beginning of the mathematics specific content.
Before we get to deep into more complex topics, let us start with what may be considered the most primitive area of mathematics: set theory.
Like most theories, we wouldn't bother having a whole theory for something not punctuated by subtleties.
So we begin as we do with defining what we're talking about; but what is a set?

Naively, we usually say a set is a collection\footnote{I say collection since group is already taken.} of things.
Why is this naive?
You'll see in section~\ref{set:russellsparadox}.

\section{A First Pass At Set Theory}
For out first pass of set theory we will begin with \textbf{Na\"ive Set Theory}, or \textbf{NST}, ignoring future issues for the sake of building a foundational understanding.

\begin{defn}{Naive Set Theory}
  A \textbf{set} is a collection of items.
  It does not matter, for now, what the items are.
\index{element}
  If a particular item, say $a$, is in a set, say $A$, we call $a$ an \textbf{element} of $A$ or we say $a$ is in $A$.
  The boolean operator for establishing membership is $\in$, where $a \in A$ if and only if $a$ is an element of $A$.

  A set is usually denoted as a capitol Roman character.
  Later, we will decorate other symbols which are sets but have additional properties which make them easier to identify.
  To notate the set $A$ with elements $a,b,c$, we write:
  $$
    A = \left\{ a, b, c\right\}.
  $$
\end{defn}

\section{The Trouble with NST:\@ Russell's Paradox}
\label{set:russellsparadox}
Russell's Paradox is a simple proof that NST is inconsistent.
The proof is a follows: Imagine you have a set which 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Russell's Paradox]
  To show NST is inconsistent, we suppose the following
  $$
    \exists y \forall x (x \in y \iff P(x))
  $$
  and if $P(x) = x \notin x$, then
  $$
    y \in y \iff y \notin y
  $$
which means \textbf{NST} is inconsistent.
\end{proof}

So what went wrong?
It seems we are unable to make any arbitrary object an element of our set.
To solve this issue multiple theories were created, including Russell's Type Theory and Zermelo Set Theory.

\section{Type Theory}
\label{set:russelltype}

Russell, having discovered the issue with NST, create a new system called \textbf{Type Theory} to address his paradox.
In Type Theory, each term has a type and operators are restricted to operate only on specific types.
For instance, suppose we have a set of numbers with the type $natural$ and an operator, say $AddThree$.
The type definition for $AddTree$ could possibly be $ AddThree: \, natural \rightarrow  natural $.
This type definition restricts the operator to operate only on objects with the type $natural$ and is only allowed to produce objects of the type $natural$.
To illustrate this, suppose the operator $AddThree$ added three to a natural number.
Simply, this would look like
$$
AddThree\, 1 = 4
$$
for an input of 1.
Now, suppose we did the same with a real number, $0.5$; $AddThree\, 0.5 $ would be undefined as there is no operator defined for that type.

The question now is how does this resolve Russell's Paradox?
In this system, sets too have types, however, not all sets have the same type.
Suppose we have a set of objects with type 1 and the set itself would have type 2.
Type 2 sets could only contain type 1 objects.
This prevents a situation where a set could possibly contain itself.
Restricting sets in this way prevents Russell's Paradox from being formed.

Although Type Theory addresses Russell's Paradox, it has not become the primary theory for dealing with sets.
Instead Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory has been adopted as the basis of modern set theory.
