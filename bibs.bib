@article{Anderson1995Observation,
    abstract = {{A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.}},

We place the existing data from relativistic heavy-ion experiments at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) into perspective and provide an overview of the techniques and strategies that will be employed in the search for the quark-gluon plasma at heavy-ion colliders, such as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).}},

statements can be made than about arbitrary differential equations admitting of

therefore, represents a combination of the methods of the formal calculus of
variations with those of Lie's group theory. For special groups and problems in
variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel and
Herglotz for special finite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance
Fokker), Weyl and Klein for special infinite groups. Especially Klein's second

    abstract = {{While fusion energy has been praised for decades as a clean alternative to fission, it has been increasingly recognized, and explored in detailed studies, that neither the economic competitiveness nor the environmental and safety advantages of fusion will materialize automatically. In the fission community, a second generation of reactor concepts is being proposed which aims at passive safety and improved environmental features. A similar trend can be identified within the fusion community, where the environmental and safety issues must be addressed even longer before a first generation of fusion power plants had the chance to prove its scientific, engineering and economic feasibility. Within the Magnetic Confinement Fusion approach, two developmental routes are being envisaged. One is the attempt to find innovative ways for the development of the Tokamak-which is, at present, by far the most developed confinement concept-into an acceptable D-T fueled power reactor. The other route is to investigate alternatives based on other fuel cycles, and/or on other confinement concepts. Examples are the D-He3 fueled High Field Tokamak and truely alternative concepts such as D-He3-fueled Field-Reversed Configurations. This paper explores some important features of the advanced fuel fusion approach. The results of the authors' own research work on the potential of advanced fuels for a more attractive energy source is reported, together with a review of relevant studies that have been undertaken or were recently completed elsewhere}},

In view of the interdisciplinary nature of the subject, we include a brief introduction into several topics  ” for pedestrians”. Some fundamental questions addressed are: Why is sQGP such a good liquid? What is the nature of (de)confinement and what do we know about  ” magnetic” objects creating it? Do they play any important role in sQGP physics? Can we understand the AdS/CFT predictions, from the gauge theory side? Can they be tested experimentally? Can AdS/CFT duality help us understand rapid equilibration/entropy production? Can we work out a complete dynamical  ” gravity dual” to heavy ion collisions?}},

The plasma undergoes compression/expansion (C/E), parallel to B by centrifugal force and perpendicular to B by B variation, providing a thermal cycle which recovers most (\&gt;95\%) of heating as mechanical energy. This gives a  ” Q-amplifier” for beam-target systems. Centrifugally confined Boron plasma undergoes C/E by slow, cross-B interchange activity. Parallel and perpendicular C/E are matched by the rotation profile which arises naturally. Hot plasma is heated and cold plasma is cooled. Beam-target fusion reactions occur in the hot plasma region and expansion returns most of the heat energy as rotation energy. Rotation energy, in turn, produces waves which drive protons to an energy near the fusion peak cross section. A possible machine, including the arrangement of magnets and HV, is described.}},

The main features of this concept are: (1) formation of large-flux Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasmas by merging two spheromaks with opposite helicities; (2) flexibility to assess FRC stability by varying the plasma shape and kinetic parameter, by using passive stabilizers, and by injecting energetic ions; (3) sustainment of the FRC for a time significantly longer than the energy confinement time using an ohmic transformer and/or neutral beam injection. Experiments carried out in TS-3/4 and SSX and more recently in Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) have further verified the effectiveness of this formation scheme for large-flux FRCs. An improved understanding of FRC stability over plasma shape and kinetic parameter has been obtained in MRX. New numerical simulations showed that FRC plasmas can be globally stabilized by injecting energetic ions. Many of these aspects of the SPIRIT concept can be further studied in the current MRX device.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;A new experiment is under development for the study of turbulence, flow, and cross-field transport in a field-reversed configuration. The facility is a merged-spheromak device driven by magnetized coaxial plasma guns. Experimental emphasis is given to advanced diagnostic development, including high spatial resolution and high time resolution instruments for measurement of fluctuating quantities and bulk velocity in high beta plasmas. Instruments at various stages of development include a multichord quadrature CO2 interferometer, a multichannel Mach-probe array, a multifrequency reflectometry system, a multi-point Doppler spectroscopy probe, and a number of magnetic diagnostics. Technical details of the experimental facility and planned studies are described.}},
