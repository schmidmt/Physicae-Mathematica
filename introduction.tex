\subsection*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Introduction}
	\indent
	I began writing this book while attending the University of Colorado at Boulder.
	I'm writing this to help solidify my understanding of physics.
	My idea is if I am able to explain the concepts and mathematics behind physical theories then I understand them myself.
	This is not meant to be an introduction but simply a review of what is covered in an undergraduate curriculum.
	Hope you enjoy.\\
